# My NixOS config

Totally unfinished, and dont know if Im structuring it correctly. But it works so thats cool.

Might change the greetd greeter so that it looks cooler.

## Todolist
- [x] Upload on github
- [x] Setup Hyprland to work at all
- [x] Setup login with greetd and tuigreet
- [x] Setup wallpapers with swww
- [x] Setup pipewire(audio)
- [ ] Setup waybar(status bar)
- [ ] Setup rofi(app launcher)
- [ ] Write a nvim config
- [ ] Setup compilers and everything for dev
- [ ] Add double monitor support
---

## Installation
Cant confirm that it works, will try it after todolist is done.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/szulf/nixos-config
```

Change the nixos/hardware-configuration.nix to the one generated in your /etc/nixos.

Theoretically should work. Theoretically.
