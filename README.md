## Installation
Cant confirm that it works, will try it after todolist is done.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/szulf/nixos-config
```

Change the nixos/hardware-configuration.nix to the one generated in your /etc/nixos.

Theoretically should work. Theoretically.
Oh and it probably only works if you have and Nvidia GPU.
